subtitle: Decodification Project
banner_content: |
  This site collects summaries and interpretations of soldiers’ letters from World War I and World War II, based on documents consulted in national archives.

  We **do not** publish original scans or full transcriptions.  
  Instead, each entry contains:

  - Archive reference
  - Date and place of writing
  - Very short description of the sender and recipient
  - A summary of the letter (decodification)
  - Brief historical interpretation
