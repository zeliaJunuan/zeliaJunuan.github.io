This site collects summaries and interpretations of soldiers' letters from World War I and World War II, based on documents consulted in national archives.

We **do not** publish original scans or full transcriptions.  
Instead, each entry contains:

- Archive reference  
- Date and place of writing  
- Very short description of the sender and recipient  
- A summary of the letter (decodification)  
- Brief historical interpretation
